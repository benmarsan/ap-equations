# Fluids

## Buoyancy 

### Buoyant Force

$$
    F_B = \rho_fV_{disp}g
$$

Buoyancy depends on density of the fluid and the displacing volume of the object. When
an object is floating, $F_B$ is equal to the force of gravity.

## Flow

AP fluids are generally assumed to be incompressible and have no turbulence/friction,
so flow rate/continuity is useful.

### Flow Rate

$$
    Q = \frac{V}{\Delta t}\\
    Q = \frac{lA}{\Delta t}\\
    Q = vA
$$

### Flow Continuity Equation

$$
    Q_1 = v_1a_1 = v_2a_2 = Q_2
$$

## Pressure

$$
    P = \frac{F}{A}
$$

### Pascal's Equation

$$
    P_1 = P_2
    \frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}
$$

## Bernoulli's Equation

$$
    P_1 - P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho \left(v_2^2 - v_1^2\right) + \rho g\left(y_2 - y_1\right)
$$

### Useful conservation of energy form
$$
    P_1 + \rho gy_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \rho gy_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2
$$
