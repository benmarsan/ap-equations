# Thermodynamics

## First Law of Thermodynamics

$$
\Delta U = Q + W
$$

## Heat/Energy Equations

### The big daddy of thermo
$$
    U = \frac{1}{2}mv_{rms}^2 = \frac{3}{2}Nk_BT = \frac{3}{2}nRT = \frac{3}{2}PV
$$

This equation is derived from the kinetic energy of a single molecule and the
ideal gas law.

### Specific heat
$$
    Q = mc\Delta T
$$

Temperature to raise mass $m$ of substance with specific heat $c$, $\Delta T$
degrees. If there is a phase change, then you need to calculate the energy for
that with the latent heat equation.

### Latent heat
$$
    Q_F = mL_F \\
    Q_V = mL_V
$$

Use latent heat equations to calculate energy required for phase changes (fusion
or vaporization).

### Efficiency

$$
    e = \frac{Q_H - Q_C}{Q_H} = \frac{W}{Q_H}
$$

### Ideal efficiency (Carnot Engine)

$$
    e_c = \frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}
$$

For a Carnot engine, the efficiency can be determined by the temperatures of the
heat reservoirs because of entropy or something.

### Heat transfer rate (conduction)

$$
    \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{kA\Delta T}{L}
$$
